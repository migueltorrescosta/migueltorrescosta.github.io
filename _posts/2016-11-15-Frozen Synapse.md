Today I found this gem from when I was in highschool. Frozen Synapse is a mixture between Call of Duty (or any First Person Shooter) and Chess. This might sound unusual but it is an amazing mixture. YOu are the team's tactician advising everyone what to do, and the game evolves in turns:

### Planning Phase

You're the tactician and at the start of the game you order your units to move/send grenades, duck for cover,... as you think is best ( and so does the enemy tactician ). At your disposal you might have soldiers, snipers, grenade launchers, rocket launchers and others, depending on the match you are playing.

### Outcome

5 seconds of battle are played where your strategy is ran against your enemy's strategy.

See the [Manual here](http://icebrain.free.fr/guides/official-manual/) or [Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdW-IH1Atvs&t=188s). It's easier to learn than it looks at first!

Tell me if you want to play :)

This picture is from Synapse 2 because the graphics look better, but the game is pretty much the same.
If it is unclear, the red dots in the picture are the enemy's team, we are the green team and the green squares connected by the white lines is our movement plan.
