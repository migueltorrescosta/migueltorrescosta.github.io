<b>Problem:</b> Suppose that you have 2 vaccines $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$ such that $$ \alpha $$ has an overall better success rate than $$ \beta $$. We say that, if, for a randomly selected person, thereÂ´s a higher likelihood that $$ \alpha $$ will cure him, then $$ \alpha $$ is better than $$ \beta $$. Is it true that $$ \alpha $$ is better than $$ \beta $$ ?

<b>Solution:</b> The answer is no. The easiest way is to show it by giving a counter example. Divide the patients are devided into 2 groups, the high risk group $$ X $$ and low risk group $$ Y $$. If $$ \alpha $$ is the more efficient but more expensive vaccine then it makes sense to use for group $$ X $$ . Suppose that we have the following number of patients for each vaccine/in each group:

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} 
& X & Y \\ \hline
\alpha & 9900 & 100 \\ \hline
\beta & 100 & 99900 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$

and the following chances of success:

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} 
& X & Y \\ \hline
\alpha & 0.50 & 0.99 \\ \hline
\beta & 0.10 & 0.90 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$

As you can see Vaccine A has better performance in each group, but what happens when we consider the overall effectiveness of the vaccine?

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} 
Vaccine & Performance & Calculation \\ \hline
\alpha & 0.5049 & \frac{9900*0.50 + 100*0.99}{9900+100} \\ \hline
\beta & 0.8992 & \frac{100*0.10 + 99900*0.90}{100+99900} \\ \hline
\end{array}$$

Hence Vaccine $$ \beta $$ outperforms Vaccine $$ \alpha $$ by roughly 40% when we only consider the overall performance.

Next time when someone claims to have improved the efficiency of something, be sure to check how that improvement was confirmed.
