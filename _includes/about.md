I like to think about puzzles such as the ones below (Currently the list is a bit short, but I´ll add more). Currently I´m curious about Machine Learning and Stochastic Calculus. During the rest of my free I might be doing any of the following:

- Playing around with my dogs
- Catan (and other Board Games)
- [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) (party game)
- Snooker
- Quidditch
- Starcraft II
- Tango

If you want to be up to date with the Puzzles available there is an [RSS Feed]({{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for you. This website is work in progress, and I´m very receptive of suggestions for improving it.
