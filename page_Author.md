I'm a 1995 kid who enjoys mathematics (hooray for Combinatorics), and if possible I would do all my work in pen and paper. Since I enjoy seeing the results of good theories, I end up coding a lot in my free time. This resulted in my [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "_posts/2014-07-23-Farfetch.md" | relative_url %}}) internship where I mostly used Python and Microsoft SQL to aid Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and my [Elliptic Curves Research Project]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "_posts/2015-09-18-Elliptic-Curves.md" | relative_url %}}) where we (a team of 15 people) were populating an Elliptic Curve Database.

When I'm not doing something related to the above I might be:

- Playing around with my dogs.
- Thinking about random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "_posts/2013-09-29-Delfos.md" | relative_url %}}) ).
- Strategy/Resource games such as Catan, [Werewolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), Starcraft, Age of Empires, Don't Starve Together and many others. Add me on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/{{ site.author.steam}}) if you want to join me in a game.
- [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Football and sports in general.
- Learning how to play chess (challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mtorres73))
