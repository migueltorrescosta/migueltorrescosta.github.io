<h1 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>

Hey! I've created this page as a mixture between sharing random things I like (such as [The Egg]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2016-03-10-egg.md %})) and an Online CV/Portfolio. Uppon opening the menu you will be able to access:

- My blogs organized by topics.
- A list of [all posts]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_All_Posts.md %}).
- [Software]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Programming.md %}) I've worked with.
- Stuff about [me]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_The_Author.md %}).
- My [CV]({{site.baseurl}}{% link Miguel_Torres_Costa_CV.pdf %}).
- A link to my social profiles.

I started this page recently and I'll keep improving it over time. If you have any suggestions do tell me.
