I´m a 21 year old who likes to think about puzzles such as the ones below (Currently the list is a bit short, but I´ll add more). I am interested in making models of real life situations, particularly in relation to Machine Learning and Stochastic Calculus. During the rest of my free time I might be doing any of the following:

- Playing around with my dogs
- Catan (and other Board Games)
- [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) (party game)
- Snooker
- Quidditch
- Football
- Starcraft II
- Tango
