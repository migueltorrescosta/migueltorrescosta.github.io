## Insights, Paradoxes and Ideas

Did you know that a 99% accurate medical test for a disease that appears in 1 out of 1000 people is useless (more specifically, if you test positive you only have a 9% chance of actually having the disease).

Did you know that peaceful trenches was a surprisingly common occurrence during WWII? Nicky Case shows a wonderful explanation of why that was a winning strategy in his [Evolution of Trust](http://ncase.me/trust/) page.

If you like to stop the clock to wonder about such ideas, share me yours and I'll share you mine.
