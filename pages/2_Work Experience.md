## Research Project - Computing the average rank of elliptic curves in ordered families

#### Supervisor: Dr Jennifer Balakrishnan

Summer 2016

### Project Abstract

An elliptic curve E is the set of points (x, y) satisfying an equation of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, together with a special point “at infinity”. When the coefficients a, b are rational numbers, it is of interest to study the set of all rational points (x, y) satisfying the equation. It turns out that the rational points on E form a finitely generated abelian group, and an important invariant attached to E is the rank of this group. This project aims to explore the “average” rank of various elliptic curves in certain families by using Sage to build a database of millions of elliptic curves, then computing various important number theoretic invariants attached to these curves. There are a few different families of curves to be studied, so this project could possibly have a few students involved, if there is interest.
Who might be interested: Students who know second-year number theory and algebra, and who are interested in programming (but no experience in
programming is required).
