I've recently started spending hours daily on a single website: [Medium](https://medium.com) . I see it as a news website where anyone can publish stories, but due to Medium's underlying magic the post quality is awesome (Otherwise I wouldn't have swapped The Economist, Financial Times and others for Medium). Here are some posts to get you started:

- [Familiarity Bias](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/familiarity-bias-is-holding-you-back-its-time-to-embrace-arrow-functions-3d37e1a9bb75) - Just recently discovered this bias (and it makes total sense), Definitely worth reading.

- [The Natural Order of Money and Why Abstract Currencies Fail](https://medium.com/@roysebag/the-natural-order-of-money-and-why-abstract-currencies-fail-aad5f9f8cf89) - I don't agree with his conclusion, not only but mostly because he his comparing abstract currencies to Gold/physical currencies instead of Euros/Pounds/Dollars/fiat money. Still, his post was surprisingly informative.

- [48 Tiny Habits That Will Make You Awesome](https://medium.com/personal-growth/48-tiny-habits-that-will-make-you-awesome-d8e3959840c8) - I'm surprised at how much little changes can accomplish.

- [How Bitcoin Works](https://column.st/how-bitcoin-works-efab68f17558) - Nothing is better than reading the original paper (which he links to in his article), but this is a softer introduction if you are not familiar with the concepts involved.

- [33 lessons from the trenches of building a million dollar company](https://blog.baremetrics.com/33-lessons-from-the-trenches-of-building-a-million-dollar-company-9685fa7811bb) - A list of useful 'lessons' to consider, even though he doesn't go in-depth about any of them.

- [Here are 250 Ivy League courses you can take online right now for free](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ivy-league-free-online-courses-a0d7ae675869) - Self-explanatory

The above are all oriented to what I enjoy reading about. Medium has various topics which I did not cover. So read away, follow anyone whose articles you found interesting and subscribe to Medium to support their work.
