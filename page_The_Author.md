I'm a 1995 kid who enjoys mathematics in my free time (hooray for Combinatorics), and if possible I would do all my work in pen and paper. Since I also like to see ideas applied to real life, I have to code myself. This resulted in my [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2014-07-23-Farfetch.md %}) internship where I mostly used Python and MySQL to aid Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and my [Elliptic Curves Research Project]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2015-09-18-Elliptic-Curves.md %}) where we (a team of 15 people) were populating databases with information about Elliptic Curves.

When I'm not doing something related to the above I might be:

- Playing around with my dogs.
- Thinking about random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2013-09-29-Delfos.md %}) ).
- Strategy/Resource games (Catan, [Werewolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), Starcraft, Age of Empires, Don't Starve Together,...).
- [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Football and sports in general.
- Learning how to play chess (challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mtorres73))
