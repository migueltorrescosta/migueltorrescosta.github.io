I am a 21 year old with a Mathematics BA from Oxford University who is currently interested in Machine Learning, Manifold Learning and Stochastic Calculus. I started a project at [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}/2014/07/23/Farfetch) which was my introduction to Machine Learning (the self-learning resources online and available libraries in Python, R, Microsoft Labs,... are surprisingly detailed for self-learners). After that I also worked on a more theoretical [Research Project in Oxford]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/09/18/Elliptic-Curves/). Currently I am looking for my next challenge.

When I'm not doing the above I might be:

- Playing around with my dogs
- Solving random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}/2013/09/29/delfos/) )
- Strategy/Resource games (Catan, [Werewolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), Starcraft, Age of Empires,...)
- [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Footbal and sports in general.
- Lately I've been exploring IRC with [hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/).
