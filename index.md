I am Miguel, a maths major who can often be found on the [Serendipitous Mathematics Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Wd4UV4A) after work. I enjoy Behavioural Sciences, with a special interest in understanding knowledge / [Pricing Information]({% post_url 2020-09-10-Pricing-Information %}) and applying it to system design, like Nicky Case did to [Voting Systems](https://ncase.me/ballot/) or me developing my own forecasting platform from the ground up, [Quest Powered](https://questpowered.com).

> If you have any big ( and potentially costly ) decision and investment to make, Douglas Hubbard's Framework laid out in his book [*How to Measure Anything*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444653.How_to_Measure_Anything) provides the best approach to doing it properly. Read a [short introduction to Expected Opportunity Loss]({% post_url 2020-09-10-Pricing-Information %}) if you wish to try it alone, and reach out if you want to discuss this.

Reach out via [email](mailto:miguelptcosta1995@gmail.com?subject=Information Pricing) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wd4UV4A) if:

- You need a maths tutor.
- My background fits a project you want to develop.
- There is a potentially costly decision you need to make under a lot of uncertainty.
- You would like to debate ideas on one of the following:
  - Improving our education system by standardizing tools such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for more efficient learning, encouraging Problem Solving over root memorization or any other ideas you might have.
  - Developing a system for community priority settings, which allows for balancing the effort of a goal with its rewards.
  - Building a Vector Search Algorithm. The closest I have seen to this is [Binary Space Partition Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning), but they don't exactly solve the problem of finding the nearest vector. I sitll need to work on this.
  - [Quest Powered](https://questpowered.com), my own forecasting platform.
