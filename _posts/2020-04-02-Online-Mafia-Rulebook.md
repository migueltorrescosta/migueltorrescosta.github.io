## Game Overview

There is a narrator that will guide the game. Everyone else will be randomly split into 2 teams: the Mafia and the Townspeople. The Mafia All know each other and want to pretend to be townspeople while killing of the townspeople one by one. The Townspeople want to discover who among them are part of the Mafia.

### Requirements

- WhatsApp Group Chat

### Setup

The moderator randomly distributes the characters (listed below). There are 2 stages, day and night, which keep alternating until everyone from one of the side dies. The game starts in the day phase, in order to avoid having some character die before they have an opportunity to play.

- **Night:** Each of the characters practice the role they were assigned. The essential role that can never be missed is the one performed by the mafia: They choose a townsperson to kill. During this phase the WhatsApp Group will have messages disabled.
- **Day:** The narrator announces all the events that happened during the night. After that, messages are enabled and the townspeople start debating in the chat about who they think the mafia are or are not, based on everything that happened during nighttime. As people debate each selects the person they want to see lynched, and once someone gets a majority they are selected to be lynched. The narrator announces the character they were assigned, and we move to the night. When someone dies they are removed from the chat to keep it clear who is still playing, and to avoid comments from the departed :P 

### Characters

- **MAFIA:** You are Mafia. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you and your mates will select someone to kill. That person dies unless the doctor chose to save that person.
- **GODFATHER:** You are the godfather. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you and your mates will select someone to kill. That person dies unless the doctor chose to save that person. If you don't decide together on who to kill, you have the final vote. If the cop investigates you during the night, he sees you as a normal victim.
- **DETECTIVE:** You are the detective. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you can choose a person to investigate, and i will tell you if that person is mafia or not. The godfather appears as a normal person.
- **DOCTOR:** You are the doctor. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you choose someone to save. If that is the person the mafia chose to kill, that person does not die.
- **PROSTITUTE:** You are the prostitute. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you chose someone to spend the night with. Any special powers that person might have used don't take effect.
- **BAKER:** You are the best character anyone could be, the baker! Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Every night you chose a person and send them a cake, with any description your sick little head can think of. Game cues, plain insults, everything is welcomed :D I hope it wasn't too obvious that I love this character. The cake you send will be seen by the entire town.
- **TOWNSPEOPLE:** You are a towns person. Do not ask questions about your role in the group, only to me directly. Even though you have no special powers at night, your role is to find the mafia: Interpret everything that happened during the day to figure out who is telling the truth and who is manipulating the game.

### Practical notes

- Couples in the group. Do not reveal your character to each other. That kind of ruins the game.
- Votes must be written in this chat in a single message: "==== I _____ vote to lynch _____ ====", and nowhere else. This is done in order to make vote counting easier.
- Votes cannot be removed, only changed to another person. (i.e. I can't say I take may vote away from person X, but I can say that I vote now for person Y, in fact removing my previous vote).
- I will be counting of the votes. If there is a majority that person gets killed and the role is revealed.
- The first person to vote is a personal hero of mine for kick starting the votes.
- If after a while there is no majority, I have the option of reducing the lynching options to the most voted candidates, in practice removing the number of options (all the way down to 2 people), and forcing the town to select from those.
- If you are not using this weekend to watch the 4th part of "La Casa de Papel" you are still a kid and need to sort out your life priorities. This show is awesome.
- Don't worry about knowing all the game rules, just vote and see how it flows :P
- If you want to ask questions about your role or anything that might reveal your character, ask the question to me personally. I will post the answer in the group chat for everyone to read.

### 1st day message

Welcome everyone to the town of dies-ville. This is where people come to die. The sun rises and we are shocked to find something unusual. In the center of our little plaza there is a dead body. We look at it, disgusted, and it is the body of Zoltan! He left us but his death was not in vain, because with his death comes the awareness that there are criminals among us. We must ensure they do not survive. As such, in this ironically sunny day, we must select someone to die. Will it be you?

### 2nd day message

Good morning everyone! A beautiful sunset rises upon this blood shed town only for us to walk into our plaza and see... no one died! What a beautiful day it is indeed. The town goes to the bakery to enjoy it's death free night, and with it there is a gift. Curious, the town sees a label: "To Pedro". Pedro does the honors of getting his rightful gift, a lovely middle finger up shaped cake with a single phrase: "Stay at home or die". Will Pedro give into this threat and follow his quarantine despite the advice of one of the worlds greats, Mr Dolan Trump, or will he rebel and geopardize everything by venturing into the outdoors? For now, the time has come to look into lynching a mobster. Will we repeat the mistake from our previous day just to find out that we lynched one of our own? 

### 2nd day final vote count
- (8) **Cheyenne:** Tushita, Fons, Joao, Andi, Ananth, Luiza, Agnes, Claudia
- (5) **Ananth:** Nadine, Cheyenne, Mar, David, Pedro

### 3rd day message

Good morning everyone! A sad day arises, not only because of the CoViD hovering over everyone's heads, but also because the doctor has failed us this night in his endeavors. The honorable Nadine Helmi was found  hanging by her neck at her home. An house search found nothing. No detective network to get information, no magical doctor pills to bring the dead back to life, nothing. Nadine was a TOWNSPERSON. At least we have a cake to console ourselves with. We all move to the bakery and we have a cake addressed to Ananth. It is heart shaped. Love is in the air. Ananth goes for it, butterflies in his stomach as he wonders who the mistery cake sender is. He can't wait to get to know her (damn, does he hope it is not an him). He goes for the cake and his dreams shatter. Magic takes over the cake the second Ananth touches it, changing it's colour to the darkest black anyone has ever seen. From within the black, 3 words pop up in blood red: "YOU ARE WRONG". Ananth cries.

### 3rd day final vote count
- (8) **Ananth:** Pedro, Claudia, Luiza, Joao, Andi, Tushita, Anastasia, Ananth

### 4th day message

Good morning everyone! A new day dawns upon our faces, with the hope of a Mafia killed but the near certainty of another victim falling pray to the mafia. Our doctor did a wonderful job the previous night, can he repeat his prowess? We wake up in hope only to see cut toe in our town plaza. A body part is a seal of something dark, but a toe? Pedro shows up with another toe. João finds a finger. Anastasia a ear. The town goes around finding chopped up body parts like it's easter. We assemble the puzzle pieces and start building the full picture. After a fun day out playing puzzles and doing picnic, wefind the puzzle solves to be Mar. She was dead, and not only did we solve the puzzle of her body pieces, we also solved the puzzle of her role. She was a TOWNSPERSON. For the picnic, we all had a cake, as usual. This time, it was addressed to João, with the shape of a dead horse's head. Fitting
