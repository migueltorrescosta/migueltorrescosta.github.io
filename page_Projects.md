There are many tools built to implement great ideas, but learning how to use them takes it time. If you want to explore one of these tools (or another you find interesting) together do get in touch.

* Write a [Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/)

* Setup a social network with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)

* Implementing and solving Game Theory problems using [Gambit](http://gambit.sourceforge.net/)

* Playing around with cryptocurrencies and buying some. I'd suggest [IOTA](https://iota.org/) just because I enjoyed their [whitepaper](https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf), though [Ripple](https://ripple.com/xrp/) also shows a lot of promise.
