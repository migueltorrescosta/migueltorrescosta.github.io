        <h3 id="the-beggining">The beggining</h3>

<p>Shati, with whom I worked over the summer, heard that I used to play Quidditch and they were looking for players, so she asked if I wanted to go. And that’s how, after 2 years of not playing Quidditch (but, instead Handball), I ended up joining OUQC’s (Oxford University Quidditch Club) trip to Southampton for a weekend full of matches and games.</p>

<p>The first day of matches started at 8am in Southampton, so we had to wake up by 5am. After a late night of work the day before, I did the obvious: I offered cupcakes to anyone who would make sure that I was out of bed by 5am. Thanks Shati and Rob! I got loads of snacks to last the entire weekend, got on my bike to meet them by the Pitt Rivers Museum and we set of to Southampton. It was a quiet trip, with everyone (but the driver! ) falling asleep.</p>

<h3 id="old-friends">Old friends</h3>

<p>I only played Quidditch during my first year in Oxford (2013/14), so I wasn’t expecting to see so many familiar faces: Luke and his amazing (yet aggressive :P) gameplay tactics. Abby who argued relentlessly about how languages should be allowed to evolve naturally from common use instead of being forced upon everyone by a select few who decide what is proper vocabulary and grammar (thankfully Shakespear agrees with Abby). David who amazed me with his techy robotic arm that he worked on during his time at Oxford. Jan with whom I had the pleasure of teaching high school kids how to play Quidditch (and noticing how teachers try to be cheeky way more often than students), and many others who taught me how to play a long time ago.</p>

<p>There were 17 teams playing from the South of England, and the top 16 would play in the BQC (British National Cup) alongside the top 16 teams from the Southern Cup. Further, the top 3 teams would also go to the EQC (European Quidditch Cup). Oxford sent 2 teams, the Radcliffe Chimeras (our first team) and the Quidlings (our second team). Both were confident of going to the BQC, but we further wanted to take the Chimeras to the EQC.</p>

<p>The Quidlings started playing first and for Simon it was bad. He was tackled and fell into the ground, suffering a whiplash. He was subbed immediately and after speaking with him for a while it became obvious that he was suffering from short term memory loss. The first aid came to help him and after a while he was feeling better, recalling all that he had forgotten (not sure if by actual remembering it or by being told what happened), but he wouldn’t be able to play the rest of the tournment, so he watched.</p>

<p>Still (jumping ahead many events), the Quidlings secured their place in BQC. Regarding the Chimeras: Our first match was against the Werewolves. For those of you unfamiliar with them, they were the only non-University based team in the tournment. Instead, they gathered the best players from London (picking from many Universities) and practiced together during all summer. Still, nothing prepared us for the result: 160*-0 (If you don’t play the game, know that each hoop scored means 10 points and the * indicates who got the snitch catch, worth 30 points).</p>

<p>After this game you can imagine our spirit wasn’t in top shape. Still, our great captains (particular kudos for Olivia, who always had kind words to share) managed to muster our energies and made sure we wouldn’t go eydown without a fight. Hence we played Exeter and Reading Saturday afternoon and we managed to win them both.</p>

<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>

<p>Given the scores we ended up 7th overall in the above group stage (given victories/losses and point differences), and Warwick 2nd. Hence we were playing them the following day (quarter finals, winner stays on). We fought well but so did Warwick, and we were outperformed. They were an amazing team (who stole Jesus, one of our players from way back when I played in first year :P ), and they carried on to the semifinals against the London Unspeakables (who, btw, won against SQC in the quarterfinals, an incredible victory given everyone’s high expectactions of SQC this year). They won handly (110* - 0) and went on to the finals against the Werewolves. Having defeated us so badly in our first match, we were expecting</p>
