## VR Headset

[Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) seems to be the best Headset so far, but they only support Windows. A few other headsets are available, but they either exist for specific platforms (see [Playstation's VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/)) or they are still work in progress (with latency issues that cause headaches,...). After having tried Oculus Rift 2 times (one playing tennis and another one just walking around a 'relaxing' environment), I want to test what games I can make with it.

## Racing Drone

I'll let the video below do the talking.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSZmSNL_0r8?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

How awesome is that?

## Monitors

I can never have enough monitors (up to 6 I think. After that it should be enough). I'm not picky about which monitors though.
