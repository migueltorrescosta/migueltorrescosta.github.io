## Insights, Paradoxes and Ideas

Did you know that a 99% accurate medical test for a disease that appears in 1 out of 1000 people is useless (more specifically, if you test positive you only have a 9% chance of actually having the disease).

If you like to stop the clock to wonder about such ideas, share me yours and I'll share you mine.
