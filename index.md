I'm a 1995 kid who enjoys mathematics (hooray for Combinatorics), and if possible I would do all my work in pen and paper. Since I enjoy seeing the results of good theories, I end up coding a lot in my free time. This resulted in my [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2014-07-23-Farfetch.md %}) internship where I mostly used Python and Microsoft SQL to aid Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and my [Elliptic Curves Research Project]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2015-09-18-Elliptic-Curves.md %}) where we (a team of 15 people) studied the properties of certain Elliptic Curves families.

When I'm not doing something related to the above I might be:

- Playing around with my dogs.
- Thinking about random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2013-09-29-Delfos.md %}) ).
- Strategy/Resource games such as Catan, [Werewolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), Starcraft, Age of Empires, Don't Starve Together and many others. Add me on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/{{ site.author.steam}}) if you want to join me in a game.
- [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Football and sports in general.
- Learning how to play chess (challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mtorres73))

My [CV]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CV.pdf %}) and a list of [Software]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Software.md %}) I've worked with are available online. I'm currently looking for work (Here's my generic [Cover Letter]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CoverLetter.pdf %})), so do get in touch if you know of an open vacancy.
Further, if you're looking for a part-time maths tutor (or know someone who is) feel free to share my [UniversityTutor](http://porto.universitytutor.com/tutors/944174) page.

I started a [Blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Posts.md %}) with a mix of my interests (See it organised by [tags]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Tags.md %})). I also have a brief summary of [who I am]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Author.md %}).

If you enjoy this blog/webpage consider having a look at my [wishlist]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Wishlist.md %}).
