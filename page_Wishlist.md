## Insights, Paradoxes and Ideas

Did you know that a 99% accurate medical test for a disease that appears in 1 out of 1000 people is useless (more specifically, if you test positive you only have a 9% chance of actually having the disease).

Did you know that peaceful trenches was a surprisingly common occurrence during WWII? Nicky Case shows a wonderful explanation of why that was a winning strategy in his [Evolution of Trust](http://ncase.me/trust/) page.

If you like to stop the clock to wonder about such ideas, share me yours and I'll share you mine.

## Building things

Discovering how to build things is great, as long as one puts the time in to do it. Since doing something together is always better, get in touch if you want to:

* Write your first [Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/)
* Setup your own social network with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
* Play around with cryptocurrencies and wallets.

If you have something else in mind that seems interesting do get in touch.
