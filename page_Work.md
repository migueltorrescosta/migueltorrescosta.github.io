I am a 24 year old mathematician who likes to discuss anything and everything.

My [CV]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CV.pdf %}) describes work I have done in the past, and my current objective is to find the right task for myself, be it making jaw-dropping web-apps for marvelous people, teaching the little I know to launch others into their goals or something else entirely which I am yet to find.

My only clue is that I enjoy reading about mathematics in my free time, be it how entropy can be a great measure of information, how Simpson's paradox shows that trend analysis is incredibly counter-intuitive or how Game Theory fits in so well with Darwin's theory of evolution with practical concepts such as Evolutionary Stable States and Nash Equilibria.

In the meantime, reach out to me if you:
- Are looking for a Python Data Analyst for a project.
- Are looking for a Maths tutor. I currently tutor 3 people, and here's my [University Tutor Page](http://universitytutor.com/tutors/944174).


# Software

Software I've worked with, by order of experience/preference. I try to keep this updated, but there's more to life than updating this list.

<details><summary>Python & Jupyter Notebooks</summary>
<br>
This is my preferred language, having used it the most for the past 3 years. I´ve worked with Pandas for database management, scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning algorithms and matplotlib for presenting the results. I have also tested many minor algorithms for simpler problems.<br></details>

<details><summary>Haskell</summary>
<br>
It was the main language used for a Functional Analysis course I took in 2014. Even though I haven´t used it since 2014, I enjoyed how similar it is to math in its functional approach. It was more intuitive to code than any other language I've used, including Python.<br></details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>
<br>
I've used it as my OS for 6 years now. I am impressed by how user friendly it is, given the initial goal by Linus of making a coder friendly OS.<br></details>

<details><summary>GitHub</summary>
<br>
Everyone uses it nowadays. Or GitLab. Or Bitbucket.<br></details>

<details><summary>Microsoft SQL & MySQL</summary>
<br>
For specific needs you might prefer other technologies, but I find these to be a good starting place or any company to manage their DBs. Anything but CSVs and flatfiles.<br></details>

<details><summary>Java</summary>
<br>
Used it briefly at LTP Labs for an agency based model project.<br></details>

<details><summary>R</summary>
<br>
Used it to quickly test different Machine Learning algorithms, so that I could understand the performance before implementing anything. Not my language of choice, but I can't argue with how incredibly fast it was to prototype.<br></details>

<details><summary>Microsoft Labs</summary>
<br>
Used it for the same reason as R. It is a surprisingly intuitive out of the box tool to use.<br></details>

<details><summary>SageMath</summary>
<br>
It was needed for the Elliptic Curves Project at Oxford University during the Summer of 2016. I was impressed by the simplicity of the code needed to work with intrincate mathematical objects (namely elliptic curves over arbitrary rings, which I used extensively). On a side note Mathematica and SageMath are really interesting for their ability to do symbolic algebra calculations (which also helps when trying to avoid errors in numerical calculations).<br></details>

<details><summary>SketchUp</summary>
<br>
Spent a lot of time building up models during highschool. Fun days.<br></details>

<details><summary>Unity</summary>
<br>
I've played around it during a Workshop organized by the Computer Science group at Porto's University. It is a surprisingly straighforward tool to use.<br></details>

<details><summary>C++</summary>
<br>
I have used Python since I started my Maths degree, but before that I used to play with C++ a lot. I eventually changed to Python since most of my current coding does not require the speed C++ gives, and Python is a lot faster to code.<br></details>

<details><summary>C\#</summary>
<br>
Used it for 2 G-Research competitions, one in Oxford and one in London (both of these were 1 day events). It is also essential for any non-trivial use of Unity's game development software.<br></details>

<details><summary>Scala</summary>
<br>
Was the language used for the <i>Imperative Programming</i> and <i>Design & Analysis of Algorithms</i> classes I took in 2014. Cool course, but not so cool language.<br></details>

<details><summary>HTML & CSS</summary>
<br>
I used it for this website, which is work in progress. There is also some Ruby and Jekyll to this, but I´ve mostly edited snippets of code in the web. It got things done.<br></details>

<details><summary>Microsoft Office</summary>
<br>
I´ve used Microsoft Excel to build a ruin theory model based on a Poisson Distribution, compound with a Normal Distribution.<br></details>
