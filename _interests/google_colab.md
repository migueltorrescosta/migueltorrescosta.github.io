Numerical literacy is an essential skill to have in today's data driven world. This doesn't come (only) from solving equations, but understanding how data behaves and relates to each other.<br> Google Colab created an environment where we can develop interactive Python Notebooks, available online for anyone to use, without the need for registration or any other obstacle on the way. <br> We can make Monte Carlo Simulation's Simpson's Paradox or Lebesgue Integration intuitive. Which ideas would you want to see shared?
