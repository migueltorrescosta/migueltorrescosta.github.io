### Computing the average rank of elliptic curves in ordered families

<strong>Supervisor: Dr Jennifer Balakrishnan</strong>

An elliptic curve $$ E $$ is the set of points $$ (x, y) $$ satisfying an equation of the form $$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$, together with a special point “at infinity”. When the coefficients $$ a $$, $$ b $$ are rational numbers, it is of interest to study the set of all rational points $$ (x, y) $$ satisfying the equation. It turns out that the rational points on $$ E $$ form a finitely generated abelian group, and an important invariant attached to $$ E $$ is the rank of this group.

During the project we explored the “average” rank of various elliptic curves in certain families by using Sage to build a database of millions of elliptic curves, then computing various important number theoretic invariants attached to these curves.
