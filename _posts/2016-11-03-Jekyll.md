I have been wanting to have an easy to use/CV/Personal Website to use for a long time. I tried different websites, but nothing was really as flexible as it claimed to be. There was always something that the websites lacked, wether it was because they asked you to pay for each extra functionality or just because they made their product according to what they personally needed, and not necessarily something that everyone could use.

Anyway, today I decided to give a shot to GitHub pages and Jekyll. Since Windows and coding is usually a mess, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop (Dual Boot). Having done it before, that was fast. Then I downloaded Ruby, RubyGem, Jykell and everything turned out to be quite smooth. The hardest part was (since I didn't want to start a website from scratch) finding a nice template. After looking around for a while I found the one you're looking at right now. (Thank you [Gaohaoyang](https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io) ). The only thing that didn't work as planned were the share buttons. Most of them were based on work done in [Baidu](http://www.baidu.com/). Hence I dived into the HTML and not having worked with HTML before, this sort of edits were fairly easy to make (I found share buttons in English, found where the original share buttons and swapped the code).

I'll still try to see how much personalisation I can give to this website (I'll probably add my CV as a page eventually), but until then I have to say I am completely satisfied with Jekyll. Kudos.

EDIT: Actually there's one thing which is annoying me greatly: I have yet to figure out how to render the apostrophe's properly. The spacing is off-puting!
