## About me

I am working on my taught Master´s in Mathematics at Oxford University (I´ll be done in July 2017). I have applied Machine Learning techniques during a summer internship. As a pure mathematician I haven´t been exposed to implementations of these ideas during my course, but I have done so during internships.

I am currently trying to find a project to work on for the next few years in order to improve my programming skills. Do <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a> if you have anything in mind.

During my free time I enjoy sports, strategy games and puzzles. Here is one of my favourites:

<b>a)</b> Suppose that you have a biased coin with probability $$ p $$ of getting heads. Can you simulate an unbiased coin?

<b>b)</b> Instead, if you have a unbiased coin and a given $$ p \in [0,1] $$
, can you simulate a coin with probability $$ p $$ of getting heads?

<b>c)</b> Whenever possible, what is the minimum number of expected coin flips you need for both part <b>a)</b> and <b>b)</b> ?
