This Saturday OK Estudante was looking for a Portuguese student who studied in the UK to do a workshop (as they mention [here](http://okestudante.pt/prepara-te/workshops-ingles/) )for prospetive students. The theme was Time & Money Management, and so I started preparing the workshop. The guidelines I was given were that I only had to tell them about my personal experience (It would be hard for me to know how everything works in all of the UK's universities. Not impossible, but pretty hard), and try my best to answer all of their questions.
I managed to scrape up a worth while list of things to say, but since I was meant to answer their questions and have the participants practice their English I left roughly half of the time given for that. There were 4 groups of 15 students each coming, so it was an audience small enough to be interactive.
The first 30mins of each workshop felt really strange. Even though I had done presentations before, I wasn't used to having such a small audience in such a small audience with next to no interactions.
