IÂ´ve been in Oxford for 2 weeks tomorrow, and things are looking pretty good. The routine is all coming back. Lectures officially
started today, but I have Mondays free so IÂ´ll be starting tomorrow. My room is huge (bigger than any I had before in my life), so IÂ´m even getting a table and 4 chairs. It will be my tiny little living room within my bedroom.

We had the FresherÂ´s Bop 2 days ago, and I have to admit I never expected to dance tango to the sound of disco music (Warning: itÂ´s a bad idea, the rhythm gets completely screwed). During that night I met my college grandkids, saw my kids again after a long summer and â€˜oldÂ´ friends. For those of you wondering what the hell IÂ´m talking about, we have a college system in which fresherÂ´s marry during the first year and when they go into 2nd year they are given kids who they have to look after and make sure they have everything they need in Uni. ItÂ´s a nice system for making sure everyone fits in, and it allows for many incest related jokes (my son married his cousin. DisgustingðŸ˜› ).
I started my work as the HandballÂ´s Secretary, and I never expected bureaucracy to be so much work (I know people complain, but still). Hopefully, it will all be done by the end of this month and afterwards things should run more smoothly. Still, we got quite a few good strong players during FresherÂ´s Fair, so when the matches start it will all have been worth it.
