        <title>Frozen synapse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I found this gem from when I was in highschool. Frozen Synapse is a mixture between Call of Duty (or any First Person Shooter) and Chess. This might sound unusual but it is an amazing mixture. YOu are the team’s tactician advising everyone what to do, and the game evolves in turns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-phase&quot;&gt;Planning Phase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re the tactician and at the start of the game you order your units to move/send grenades, duck for cover,… as you think is best ( and so does the enemy tactician ). At your disposal you might have soldiers, snipers, grenade launchers, rocket launchers and others, depending on the match you are playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outcome&quot;&gt;Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 seconds of battle are played where your strategy is ran against your enemy’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://icebrain.free.fr/guides/official-manual/&quot;&gt;Manual here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdW-IH1Atvs&amp;amp;t=188s&quot;&gt;Gameplay&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easier to learn than it looks at first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me if you want to play :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../photos/frozen_synapse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Frozen Synapse&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture is from Synapse 2 because the graphics look better, but the game is pretty much the same.
If it is unclear, the red dots in the picture are the enemy’s team, we are the green team and the green squares connected by the white lines is our movement plan.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to have an easy to use/CV/Personal Website to use for a long time. I tried different websites, but nothing was really as flexible as it claimed to be. There was always something that the websites lacked, wether it was because they asked you to pay for each extra functionality or just because they made their product according to what they personally needed, and not necessarily something that everyone could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today I decided to give a shot to GitHub pages and Jekyll. Since Windows and coding is usually a mess, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop (Dual Boot). Having done it before, that was fast. Then I downloaded Ruby, RubyGem, Jykell and everything turned out to be quite smooth. The hardest part was (since I didn’t want to start a website from scratch) finding a nice template. After looking around for a while I found the one you’re looking at right now. (Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io&quot;&gt;Gaohaoyang&lt;/a&gt; ). The only thing that didn’t work as planned were the share buttons. Most of them were based on work done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baidu.com/&quot;&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;. Hence I dived into the HTML and not having worked with HTML before, this sort of edits were fairly easy to make (I found share buttons in English, found where the original share buttons and swapped the code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll still try to see how much personalisation I can give to this website (I’ll probably add my CV as a page eventually), but until then I have to say I am completely satisfied with Jekyll. Kudos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../photos/jekyll.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jekyll&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually there’s one thing which is annoying me greatly: I have yet to figure out how to render the apostrophe’s properly. The spacing is off-puting!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quidditch southern cup</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beggining&quot;&gt;The beggining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shati, with whom I worked over the summer, heard that I used to play Quidditch and they were looking for players, so she asked if I wanted to go. And that’s how, after 2 years of not playing Quidditch (but, instead Handball), I ended up joining OUQC’s (Oxford University Quidditch Club) trip to Southampton for a weekend full of matches and games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of matches started at 8am in Southampton, so we had to wake up by 5am. After a late night of work the day before, I did the obvious: I offered cupcakes to anyone who would make sure that I was out of bed by 5am. Thanks Shati and Rob! I got loads of snacks to last the entire weekend, got on my bike to meet them by the Pitt Rivers Museum and we set of to Southampton. It was a quiet trip, with everyone (but the driver! ) falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-friends&quot;&gt;Old friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only played Quidditch during my first year in Oxford (2013/14), so I wasn’t expecting to see so many familiar faces: Luke and his amazing (yet aggressive :P) gameplay tactics. Abby who argued relentlessly about how languages should be allowed to evolve naturally from common use instead of being forced upon everyone by a select few who decide what is proper vocabulary and grammar (thankfully Shakespear agrees with Abby). David who amazed me with his techy robotic arm that he worked on during his time at Oxford. Jan with whom I had the pleasure of teaching high school kids how to play Quidditch (and noticing how teachers try to be cheeky way more often than students), and many others who taught me how to play a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;group-stage&quot;&gt;Group Stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 17 teams playing from the South of England, and the top 16 would play in the BQC (British National Cup) alongside the top 16 teams from the Southern Cup. Further, the top 3 teams would also go to the EQC (European Quidditch Cup). Oxford sent 2 teams, the Radcliffe Chimeras (our first team) and the Quidlings (our second team). Both were confident of going to the BQC, but we further wanted to take the Chimeras to the EQC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quidlings started playing first and for Simon it was bad. He was tackled and fell into the ground, suffering a whiplash. He was subbed immediately and after speaking with him for a while it became obvious that he was suffering from short term memory loss. The first aid came to help him and after a while he was feeling better, recalling all that he had forgotten (not sure if by actual remembering it or by being told what happened), but he wouldn’t be able to play the rest of the tournment, so he watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still (jumping ahead many events), the Quidlings secured their place in BQC. Regarding the Chimeras: Our first match was against the Werewolves. For those of you unfamiliar with them, they were the only non-University based team in the tournment. Instead, they gathered the best players from London (picking from many Universities) and practiced together during all summer. Still, nothing prepared us for the result: 160*-0 (If you don’t play the game, know that each hoop scored means 10 points and the * indicates who got the snitch catch, worth 30 points).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this game you can imagine our spirit wasn’t in top shape. Still, our great captains (particular kudos for Olivia, who always had kind words to share) managed to muster our energies and made sure we wouldn’t go eydown without a fight. Hence we played Exeter and Reading Saturday afternoon and we managed to win them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knockout-stage&quot;&gt;Knockout Stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the scores we ended up 7th overall in the above group stage (given victories/losses and point differences), and Warwick 2nd. Hence we were playing them the following day (quarter finals, winner stays on). We fought well but so did Warwick, and we were outperformed. They were an amazing team (who stole Jesus, one of our players from way back when I played in first year :P ), and they carried on to the semifinals against the London Unspeakables (who, btw, won against SQC in the quarterfinals, an incredible victory given everyone’s high expectactions of SQC this year). They won handly (110* - 0) and went on to the finals against the Werewolves. Having defeated us so badly in our first match, we were expecting to see a tough match for Warwick. It was indeed tough, but Warwick manage to hold until the snitch was released by keeping the score at 10-20. At his point whoever caught the snitch would win and indeed Warwick managed to do the impossible. 3 Hips to Warwick: Hip Hip Hooray! Hip Hip Hooray! Hip Hip Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Egg</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-found-this-tale-lying-around-the-web-i-hope-you-enjoy-it-as-much-as-i-did&quot;&gt;I found this tale lying around the web. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html&quot;&gt;Link to the original post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were on your way home when you died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s when you met me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yup,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I… I died?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More or less,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you god?” You asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My kids… my wife,” you said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Will they be all right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where you come from?” You said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what’s the point of it all?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just me? What about everyone else?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All you. Different incarnations of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait. I’m everyone!?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m every human being who ever lived?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or who will ever live, yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you’re the millions he killed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m Jesus?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you’re everyone who followed him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thought for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I sent you on your way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>G Research competition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today Me, Matt and Aiken went for a high-frequency stock exchange competition. It was sponsored by G-Research ( It’s a fairly efficient way of hiring the best employees).
Unfortunately, we didn’t win (we won last year. Yay), but (as with everything in life) more time would have made a great difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some context, the stock exchange market is a place where you have instruments (company shares) and their respective market price. The price is not an absolute thing but defined by the average value at which the shares are being exchanged (and somewhat related to how the company is doing in real-life, but during the competition we didn’t consider that). There was a central mechanism which kept a record of all the transactions and offers in the market, and each participant ( a company in real life) could propose to buy/sell instruments. Whenever there is a match (I sell at a lower price than you buy, or vice-versa), the transaction occurs at the price the first of us set. We also had a ‘Black Box’ which gave us relatively accurate predictions of future prices for the instruments. By the end, the participant who makes the most money wins. The entire code was done in C# (They, G-Research, scripted the structure of the program, and then we had to complete the rest with our own ideas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a very simple idea: We take (A) the average of the last transactions, compare it to (B) our black box prediction and decide to buy if A &amp;lt; B or sell if B &amp;gt; A. This was to make sure everything was operational, and then we tried to make a quadratic approximation of the values of the past few seconds in order to predict in a long-ish term how the stock values will change (using the sign of the coefficient of x**2, and then decide to buy/sell using that value (and completely bypassing the black box given to us). Unfortunately when we were implementing it we failed at making it run without bugs during the given time, so we had to run the simpler idea (The maths for the quadratic approximation had all been worked out, but implementing things always takes longer than expected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the live test, all teams seemed to have a similar behaviour (they all improved at the same time, had the same spikes and, in general, showed the same trends). Even though some correlation is expected (because increasing the value of the instruments increases the amount of money everyone has), usually there are differences in behaviours which were missing, so probably everyone used the same algorithm. This is disappointing in the sense that no original ideas were presented. I’ll have to look into real life trading events to see sophisticated ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Start again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I´ve been in Oxford for 2 weeks tomorrow, and things are looking pretty good. The routine is all coming back. Lectures officially
started today, but I have Mondays free so I´ll be starting tomorrow. My room is huge (bigger than any I had before in my life), so I´m even getting a table and 4 chairs. It will be my tiny little living room within my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the Fresher´s Bop 2 days ago, and I have to admit I never expected to dance tango to the sound of disco music (Warning: it´s a bad idea, the rhythm gets completely screwed). During that night I met my college grandkids, saw my kids again after a long summer and ‘old´ friends. For those of you wondering what the hell I´m talking about, we have a college system in which fresher´s marry during the first year and when they go into 2nd year they are given kids who they have to look after and make sure they have everything they need in Uni. It´s a nice system for making sure everyone fits in, and it allows for many incest related jokes (my son married his cousin. Disgusting😛 ).
I started my work as the Handball´s Secretary, and I never expected bureaucracy to be so much work (I know people complain, but still). Hopefully, it will all be done by the end of this month and afterwards things should run more smoothly. Still, we got quite a few good strong players during Fresher´s Fair, so when the matches start it will all have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Farfetch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience working for a company, and overall its an experience I want to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work consisted of using testing the possibility of using Machine Learning to optimise internal operations (I’m afraid I can’t be more specific due to a confidentiality agreement, but I don’t find the operation I was focusing on to be that relevant or, for the matter, important to this post). Machine Learning is a novelty for me, as I’m an Undergrad Maths Student. I started this project having never had a course in Machine Learning, so it was fun going from the knowledge of this buzzword to actually know how it works (i.e. I now know how many algorithms that fall under the “Machine Learning” umbrella work, and I’m able to implement a subset of these using Python packages). Surprisingly it feels less incredible knowing how it works, since it always sounded like the machine was miracously learning by itself. Instead, the main idea (for the subset of algorithms which I looked into) is to map our info into a vector space of some sort and trying to figure out the manifold (or equation for non-binary outputs) which splits the data best, while keeping the manifold as simple as possible (simple being as vague as always, and left to the taste of the coder). It is important that the manifold we find fits the data, but keeping it simple usually gives us more predictive power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After self-teaching Python and MySQL I am happy with the results attained, which were continued after I left (because even though I enjoyed the project, finishing my degree is my current priority). Still, if I were to restart the project, I am confident it wouldn’t take me nearly as long to code it all. Hopefully this learning curve will stay this sharp for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t finish this post without thanking an amazing team who I had the pleasure to work with. Special Thanks to Joao and Carlos, who’ve stopped to help me many times during this 7-week project, and everyone else for their company (we have a bye-bye dinner tomorrow😛 ). Hope to see you all soon🙂&lt;/p&gt;
