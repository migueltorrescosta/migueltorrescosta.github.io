I am a 21 year old interested in Machine Learning, Manifold Learning and Stochastic Calculus. DI started a project at [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}/2014/07/23/Farfetch) which was my introduction to Machine Learning (the self-learning resources online and available libraries in Python, R, Microsoft Labs,... are surprisingly detailed for self-learners). After finishing my BA in mathematics Oxford University I worked on a theoretical [Elliptic Curves Research Project in Oxford]({{site.baseurl}}/professional/2015/09/18/Elliptic-Curves/).

When I'm not doing something similar to the above I might be:

- Playing around with my dogs
- Solving random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}/2013/09/29/delfos/) )
- Strategy/Resource games (Catan, [Werewolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), Starcraft, Age of Empires,...)
- [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Footbal and sports in general.
- Lately I've been exploring IRC with [hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/).
