I enjoy exploring different topics, with the tendency to connect everything back to mathematics. I enjoy reading, mostly mathematics, be it how entropy can be a great measure of information, how Simpson's paradox shows that trend analysis is incredibly counter-intuitive or how Game Theory fits in so well with Darwin's theory of evolution with practical concepts such as Evolutionary Stable States and Nash Equilibria. The interests below vary greatly in nature. Some are fleeting thoughts, other could become business ideas, and some are complete non-sense. Do you want to explore them together?</p>
