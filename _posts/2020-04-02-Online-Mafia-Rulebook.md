In this time of CoViD and isolation playing Mafia online is a good way to keep some sanity. For the uniniated, this is the rulebook.

## Game Overview

There is a narrator that will guide the game. Everyone else will be randomly split into 2 teams: the Mafia and the Townspeople. The Mafia All know eachother and want to pretend to be townspeople while killing of the townspeople one by one. The Townspeople want to discover who among them are part of the Mafia.

## Requirements:

- WhatsApp Group Chat

## Setup

The moderator randomly distributes the characters (listed below). The game has 2 stages, day and night, which keep alternating until everyone from one of the side dies. The game starts in the day phase, in order to avoid having some character die before they have an opportunity to play.

- **Night:** Each of the characters practice the role they were assigned. The essential role that can never be missed is the one performed by the mafia: They choose a townsperson to kill. During this phase the WhatsAppGroup will have messages disabled.
- **Day:** The narrator announces all the events that happened during the night. After that, messages are enabled and the townspeople start debating in the chat about who they think the mafia are or are not, based on everything that happened during night time. As people debate each selects the person they want to see lynched, and once someone gets a majority they are selected to be lynched. The narrator announces the character they were assinged, and we move to the night. When someone dies they are removed from the chat to keep it clear who is still playing, and to avoid comments from the departed :P 

## Characters

- **Mafia:** Every night they select, as a group, who to kill. That person will show up dead the next day.
- **Godfather:** Plays for the mafia. Looks innocent if investigated by the detective, and has the final say on who the mafia kills in case of a tie.
- **Detective:** Every night they select a person. The narrator tells the detective whether that person is part of the mafia or not.
- **Doctor:** They chose a person to save every night. If it is the same that the Mafia chose then that person does not die.
- **Prostitute:** Spends the night with someone. If that person has a power, the power does not apply.
- **Baker:** Bakes a cake for another player. The cake can be anything they want.
