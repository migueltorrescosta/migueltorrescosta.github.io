A list of things I haven't had the chance to get my hands on. Yet.

## Books

I've compiled this list using [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/65376142?shelf=to-read).

{% include goodreads.html %}

## VR Headset

[Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) seems to be the best Headset so far, but they only support Windows. A few other headsets are available, but they either exist for specific platforms (see [Playstation's VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/)) or they are still work in progress (with latency issues that cause headaches,...).

## Racing Drone

I'll let the video below do the talking.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSZmSNL_0r8?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

How awesome is that?
