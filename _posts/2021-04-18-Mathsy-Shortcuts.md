### Geometric mean is the (arithmetic) mean of magnitudes

For a set of positive numbers $ A = \\{ x_1, x_2, ... ,x_n \\} $ the arithmetic mean is defined as $\frac{1}{n} \sum {x_i} $ whereas the geometric mean is defined as $ \sqrt[n]{ \prod x_i} $, resulting in:

| $ A $ | Arithmetic Mean | Geometric Mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $ \\{ 4,9 \\} $ | $6.5$ | $ 6 $ |
| $ \\{ 1,2,4,8,16 \\} $ | $6.2$ | $ 4 $ |

The Geometric Mean becomes obvious if we write all numbers as magnitudes:

| $ A $ | Arithmetic Mean | Geometric Mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $ \\{ 2^2,2^{3.1699} \\} $ | $ 2^{2.7004} $ | $ 2^{2.58496} $ |
| $ \\{ 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4 \\} $ | $ 2^{2.632268} $ | $ 2^2 $ |

Note that $2.58496$ is just the mean of $ \\{ 2 , 3.1699 \\}$, and for the second line $2$ is the mean of $ \\{ 0,1,2,3,4 \\}$. I have written them base $2$ but any magnitude would suffice.
