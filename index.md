### Interests
The subjects below describe what I enjoy spending my time on. Reach out if you want to discuss ideas. More details into each of these can be found in my [Blog](/blog)

- **Voting Systems:** Nicky case has an amazing [interactive tutorial](https://ncase.me/ballot/)
- **[Pricing Information]({% post_url 2020-09-10-Pricing-Information %}):** Douglas Hubbard wrote an amazing introduction to this technique on his book [How to Measure Anything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444653.How_to_Measure_Anything), whose ideas I have implemented here:
I am Miguel, a maths major who enjoys Behavioural Sciences, with a special interest in understanding knowledge /  and applying it to system design, like Nicky Case did to  or me developing my own forecasting platform from the ground up, [Quest Powered](https://questpowered.com).
- Behavioural Economics: [Malcolm Gladwell's Blink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink) and [Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational) are two of my favourite books in this area. Which others would you add?
