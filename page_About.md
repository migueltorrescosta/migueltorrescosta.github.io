## The Blog

There are many concepts that I want to learn about. When reading explanations it is easy to follow everything but, without realizing it, miss overlooked details. By explaining concepts I hope to spot where my own knowledge gaps lie. Occasionally I might share other things such as [Short Stories]({% link page_Tags.md %}#short-stories) or [Ideas]({% link page_Ideas.md %}) I found in the web.

## The Author

I am a mathematician interested in Behavioral Economics, which ties with Game Theory, Behaviour Analysis, Evolutionary Psychology and other topics. This interest stemed from the core ideas found in Richard Dawkins' [The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene), Charles Darwin's [On the Origin of Species](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species), Kevin Leyton-Brown and Yoav Shoham's [Essentials of Game Theory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4253377-essentials-of-game-theory) and their more tractable yet more theoretical formulations of real life cooperation and competition situations. In particular analysis of Risk and Uncertainty are both incredibly useful and enlightening for this topic. I'd like to bring attention to Nassim Nicholas' book [Antifragile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) (which I have yet to finish).

My time is spent between reading about these ideas and occasionally programming in order to apply and play with the concepts. When I'm not doing something related to the aforementioned I might be:

* Playing around with my dogs.

* Getting hands on work done via a [mini project]({% link page_Projects.md %}).

* Reading interesting [ideas]({% link page_Ideas.md %}) from the web.

* Thinking about random problems and possible solutions (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2013-09-29-Delfos.md %}) ).

* Strategy/Resource games such as Catan, [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) and others.

* [Quidditch](http://www.ouqc.uk/), Football and sports in general.
