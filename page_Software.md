Software I've worked with, by order of experience/preference.

* language
{:toc}

## Python & Jupyter Notebooks
This is my preferred language, having used it the most for the past 3 years. I´ve worked with Pandas for database management, scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning algorithms and matplotlib for presenting the results. I have also tested many minor algorithms for simpler problems.

## Haskell
It was the main language used for a Functional Analysis course I took in 2014. Even though I haven´t used it since 2014, I enjoyed how similar it is to math (i.e. the mindset of writing functions only and using list comprehensions the same way we do in math). It fells more intuitive than any other language I've used (including the as user friendly as possible language Python).

## Ubuntu
I've used it as my OS for over a year. I like how coder friendly it is (I guess that's what Linus wanted when he started it, so kudos to him).

## GitHub
That's where I host this webpage and what we used it at Farfetch for code management. I've only needed to use the basics (pull, commit, push) but the rest is very intuitive. If you're keen on understanding how/why it works the way it works, I suggest [this](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html) post.

## Microsoft SQL & MySQL
During the Farfetch Internship I preferred using Pandas (A Python module) to organise my module due to its flexibility, but I had to use Microsoft SQL to efficiently query their database and import only the data I needed.
During the Elliptic Curve Research Project we used MySQL for handling the databases we were building (relatively small databases).

## Java
Used it recently at LTP Labs for an agency based model project. Not my favorite language, but it is incredibly powerful for Object Oriented code.

## R
Used it to quickly test different Machine Learning algorithms, so that I could have an idea on which algorithm to use for a dataset I had. I disliked the language, but I can't argue with how fast it was to get things done.

## Trello
I discovered it recently and it has become my quick note taker: Anytime I can add a card via my phone since there's a Add card to Trello Widget which allows you to do it with 2 clicks (plus the text you need to write). Then at the end/beginning of each day I can just give it a quick look and sort out what needs sorting out.

## Microsoft Labs
Used it for the same reason as R. It is a surprisingly intuitive out of the box tool to use.

## SageMath
It was needed for an Elliptic Curves Project at Oxford University during the Summer of 2016. I was impressed by the simplicity of the code needed to work with intrincate mathematical objects (namely elliptic curves over arbitrary rings, which I used extensively).

## SketchUp
Spent a lot of time playing with it during highschool.

## Unity
I've played around it during a Workshop organized by the Computer Science group at Porto's University. It is a surprisingly straighforward tool to use.

## C++
I´ve used Python since I started my Maths degree, but before that I used to play with C++ a lot. I eventually changed to Python since most of my current coding does not require the speed C++ gives, and Python is a lot faster to code.


## C\#
Used it for 2 G-Research competitions, one in Oxford and one in London (both of these were 1 day events). It is also essential for any non-trivial use of Unity's game development software.

## Scala
Was the language used for the <i>Imperative Programming</i> and <i>Design & Analysis of Algorithms</i> classes I took in 2014. Awful language.

## HTML & CSS
I used it for this website, which is work in progress. There is also some Ruby and Jekyll to this, but I´ve mostly edited work done by others.

## Microsoft Office
I´ve used Microsoft Excel to build a ruin theory model based on a Poisson Distribution, compound with a Normal Distribution.
