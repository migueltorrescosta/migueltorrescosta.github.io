I started this website recently to share my work and my maths. I'm very open to suggestions on how to improve it (Particularly if there are bugs or typos I'm unaware of).

Here you can find my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CV.pdf %}) and [Software]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Software.md %}) I've worked with. I'm currently looking for work (Here's my generic [CoverLetter]({{site.baseurl}}{% link CoverLetter.pdf %})), so do get in touch if you know of an open vacancy.
Further, if you're looking for a part-time maths tutor (or know someone who is) feel free to share my [UniversityTutor](http://porto.universitytutor.com/tutors/944174) page.

I started a [Blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Posts.md %}) with a mix of my interests (See it organised by [tags]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Tags.md %})). I also have a brief summary of [who I am]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Author.md %}).

If you enjoy this blog/webpage consider having a look at my [wishlist]({{site.baseurl}}{% link page_Wishlist.md %}).
