I am Miguel, a [Mathematics tutor](https://universitytutor.com/tutors/944174) on his free time and currently focused on understanding knowledge and the value of information. You can usually find me on the  [Serendipitous Mathematics Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Wd4UV4A) after work.

> If you have any big ( and potentially costly ) decision and investment to make, Douglas Hubbard's Framework laid out in his book [*How to Measure Anything*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444653.How_to_Measure_Anything) provides the best approach to doing it properly. [Reach out](mailto:miguelptcosta1995@gmail.com?subject=Information Pricing) if you want to discuss this or read a [short introduction to Expected Opportunity Loss]({% post_url 2020-09-10-Pricing-Information %}) if you wish to try it alone.
