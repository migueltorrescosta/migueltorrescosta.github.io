I started this website recently to share my work and my maths. I'm very open to suggestions on how to improve it (Particularly if there are bugs or typos I'm unaware of).

My [CV]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "CV.pdf" | relative_url %}}) and a list of [Software]({{site.baseurl}}{{ "page_Software.md" | relative_url }}) I've worked with are available online. I'm currently looking for work (Here's my generic [Cover Letter]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "CoverLetter.pdf" | relative_url %}})), so do get in touch if you know of an open vacancy.
Further, if you're looking for a part-time maths tutor (or know someone who is) feel free to share my [UniversityTutor](http://porto.universitytutor.com/tutors/944174) page.

I started a [Blog]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "page_Posts.md" | relative_url %}}) with a mix of my interests (See it organised by [tags]({{site.baseurl}}{{% p"age_Tags.md" | relative_url %}})). I also have a brief summary of [who I am]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "page_Author.md"  | relative_url %}}).

If you enjoy this blog/webpage consider having a look at my [wishlist]({{site.baseurl}}{{% "page_Wishlist.md" | relative_url %}}).
