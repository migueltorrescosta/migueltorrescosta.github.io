If you ever played [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), this is my solver :) . Write the words suggested, type back the resulting colours as a string (i.e. BBYGG means the first two tiles are black, the middle is Yellow and the last two are Green), and this will suggest you the words needed to solve the game :)
