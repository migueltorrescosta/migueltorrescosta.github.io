> One of my friends told me about a powerful lesson in her daughter's high-school class this winter. They're learning about the Salem Witch Trials, and their teacher told them they were going to play a game.
> 
> *"I am going to come around and whisper to each of you whether you're a witch or a normal person. Your goal is to build the largest group possible that does NOT have a witch in it. At the end, any group found to include a witch gets a failing grade."*
> 
> The teens dove into grilling each other. One fairly large group formed, but most of the students broke into small, exclusive groups, turning away anyone they thought gave off even a hint of guilt.
> 
> *"Okay"*, the teacher said. *"You've got your groups. Time to find out which ones fail. All witches, please raise your hands."*
> 
> No one raised a hand.
> 
> The kids were confused and told him he'd messed up the game.
> 
> *"Did I? Was anyone in Salem an actual witch? Or did everyone just believe what they had been told?"*
> 
> And that is how you teach kids how easy it is to divide a community.
> 
> Keep being welcoming, beautiful people. Shunning, scapegoating and dividing destroy far more than they protect. We are all in this together.
