Recent movements towards giving people choice regarding privacy, liberty and other sensitive topics are impressive, but not enough. Even though a few of us might go to great lengths to ensure their rights, many will just follow the path of least action and wonder <br><b>"Why should I bother?"</b><br>This is why options are not enough: we must change the default actions towards what is best for the people since no one, as much as I want, have the time to evaluate all the options we are offered in our lifetimes.
