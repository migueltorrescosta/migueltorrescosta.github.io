## The author

I'm a 1995 kid who enjoys mathematics (hooray for Combinatorics), and if possible I would do all my work in pen and paper. Since I enjoy seeing the results of good theories, I end up coding a lot in my free time. This resulted in my [Farfetch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2014-07-23-Farfetch.md %}) internship where I mostly used Python and Microsoft SQL to aid Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and my [Elliptic Curves Research Project]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2015-09-18-Elliptic-Curves.md %}) where we (a team of 15 people) studied the properties of certain Elliptic Curve families.
When I'm not doing something related to the above I might be:

* Playing around with my dogs.

* Getting hands on work done via a [mini project]({% link page_Projects.md %}).

* Reading interesting [Ideas]({% link page_Ideas.md %}) from the web.

* Thinking about random math problems (a pleasure I deepened during my youth at [Delfos]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2013-09-29-Delfos.md %}) ).
