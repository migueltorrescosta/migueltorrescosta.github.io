I'm Miguel, a mathematician who doesn't spend enough time with his dogs, playing group sports and reading. Speaking of which, are there any books I should add to [my bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/65376142-miguel-costa)?

I hope you enjoy the [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog). I often write about mathematics, psychology and anything else that crosses my mind.
    
Here's my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/CV.pdf">CV</a> and my <a href="https://universitytutor.com/tutors/944174">University Tutor page</a>. If there's any mathematics you or someone else want to learn about do reach out.

Other than that I like to think about forecasting and decision making. If this interests you read on about my [journey to perfect forecasting]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2020-08-19-perfect-forecasting.md %}).

Let us solve this problem together <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
