I´ve spent the last 4 years in Oxford, and the best gift from it is how many experiences you get to have through the eyes of someone else, how alive the city is with events and ideas being shared constantly. Most of all, I enjoy how in-depth and technical people get when presenting their own work. It allows me to understand how things got done to the last detail.

I have always enjoyed puzzles (and maths provides me with plenty). Spending hours figuring out how to solve a problem, write a solution, see if it might fail anywhere. I´ve learnt to be aware of my assumptions whenever I tackle a problem so that, if it fails, I know exactly why. For example, as an example of something comonly assumed, did you know that if a vaccine A has a better overall performance (in treating a disease) than vaccine B, we might still have that, by splitting the patients in groups, vaccine B outperforms A in every group?

Currently I am interested in Machine Learning and Stochastic Calculus. In particular I am interested in developing/improving software that uses techniques in any/both of the above, so that I can mix my fondness of coding with my fondness of maths.

The list of problems below is still fairly short (given how recent this website is), but I will expand it with time.

When I am not doing any of the above, I enjoy discovering new hobbies which involve either mental acuity or physical activity. These include strategy games (Starcraft, Frozen Synapse), board games (Catan, Mafia), sports (Handball, Quidditch, Basketball, Football) and others (Pool, Tango, etc).
