<sub>By order of experience/preference</sub>

#### Python & Jupyter Notebooks
This is my preferred language, having used it the most for the past 3 years. I´ve worked with Pandas for database management, matplotlib and scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning Algorithms. I have also tested many minor algorithms for simple problems

#### Haskell
It was the main language used for a Functional Analysis course I took in 2014. Even though I haven´t used for a year, I enjoyed how similar it is to math (i.e. the mindset of writing functions only and using list comprehensions the same way we do in math).

#### Microsoft SQL & MySQL
During the Farfetch Internship I preferred using Pandas (A Python module) to organise my module due to its flexibility, but I had to use Microsoft SQL to efficiently query their database and import only the data I needed.
During the Elliptic Curve Research Project we used MySQL for handling the databases we were building (relatively small databases).

#### R
Used it to quickly test different Machine Learning algorithms, so that I could know have an idea on which algorithm to use for a dataset I had

#### Microsoft Labs
Used it for the same reason as R. It is a surprisingly intuitive out of the box tool to use.

#### SageMath
It was needed for an Elliptic Curves Project at Oxford University during the Summer of 2016. I was impressed by the simplicity of the code needed to work with intrincate mathematical objects (namely elliptic curves over arbitrary rings, which I used extensively).

#### SketchUp
Spent a lot of time on it during highschool.

#### C++
I´ve used Python for the last 3 years, but before that I used to play with C++ a lot. I eventually changed to Python since most of my current coding does not require the speed C++ gives, and Python is a lot faster to code.


#### C\#
Used it for 2 G-Research competitions, one in Oxford and one in London (both of these were 1 day events).

#### Scala
Was the language used for <i>Imperative Programming</i> and <i>Design & Analysis of Algorithms</i> classes.

#### HTML & CSS
I used it for this website, which is work in progress. There is also some Ruby and Jekyll to this, but I´ve mostly edited work done by others.

#### Microsoft Office
I've used Microsoft Excel to build a small ruin theory model.
