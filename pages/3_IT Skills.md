<sub>By order of experience/preference</sub>

#### Python & Jupyter Notebooks
Quickly testing certain hypothesis (usually small algorithms for)

#### Haskell
It was the main language used for a Functional Analysis course I took in 2014. Even though I haven´t used for a year, I enjoyed how similar it is to math (i.e. the mindset of writing functions only and using list comprehensions the same way we do in math).

#### Microsoft SQL & MySQL
During the Farfetch Internship I preferred using Pandas (A Python module) to organise my module due to its flexibility, but I had to use Microsoft SQL to efficiently query their database and import only the data I needed.
During the Elliptic Curve Research Project we used MySQL for handling the databases we were building (relatively small databases).

#### R
Used it to quickly test different Machine Learning algorithms, so that I could know have an idea on which algorithm to use for a dataset I had

#### Microsoft Labs
Used it for the same reason as R. It is a surprisingly intuitive out of the box tool to use.

#### SageMath
It was needed for the Elliptic Curves Project I worked on during the Summer of 2016. I was impressed by the simplicity of the code needed to work with intrincate mathematical objects (namely elliptic curves over arbitrary rings, which I used extensively)

#### SketchUp
Spent a lot of time on it during highschool.

#### C++
I´ve used Python for the last 3 years, but before that I used to play with C++ a lot (convinced by the efficiency arguments). I eventually changed to Python since most of my current coding does not require the speed C++ gives


#### C#
Used it for 2 G-Research competitions, one in Oxford and one in London (both of these were 1 day events)

#### Scala
Used it for 

#### Microsoft Office

#### HTML & CSS (I had to use it to make this website)
