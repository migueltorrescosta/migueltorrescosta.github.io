description: Hold accountability for misinformation
column: 2
---

Misinformation is a "recent" hot topic with an old solution: Idea Futures. Misinformation is hard to navigate because we don't hold people accountable to their statements. The framework behind Idea Futures is to have key statements being "betted" on by many people with a say on the matter, and see how those statements evolve over time. Nobody can forecast the future, but we should be able to distinguish the better forecasters from the not so good forecasters.
