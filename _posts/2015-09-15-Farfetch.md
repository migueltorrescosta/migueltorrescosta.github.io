This was my first experience working for a company, and overall its an experience I want to repeat.

My work consisted of using testing the possibility of using Machine Learning to optimise internal operations (I'm afraid I can't be more specific due to a confidentiality agreement, but I don't find the operation I was focusing on to be that relevant or, for the matter, important to this post). Machine Learning is a novelty for me, as Iâ€™m an Undergrad Maths Student. I started this project having never had a course in Machine Learning, so it was fun going from the knowledge of this buzzword to actually know how it works (i.e. I now know how many algorithms that fall under the "Machine Learning" umbrella work, and I'm able to implement a subset of these using Python packages). Surprisingly it feels less incredible knowing how it works, since it always sounded like the machine was miracously learning by itself. Instead, the main idea (for the subset of algorithms which I looked into) is to map our info into a vector space of some sort and trying to figure out the manifold (or equation for non-binary outputs) which splits the data best, while keeping the manifold as simple as possible (simple being as vague as always, and left to the taste of the coder). It is important that the manifold we find fits the data, but keeping it simple usually gives us more predictive power.

After self-teaching Python and MySQL I am happy with the results attained, which were continued after I left (because even though I enjoyed the project, finishing my degree is my current priority). Still, if I were to restart the project, I am confident it wouldn't take me nearly as long to code it all. Hopefully this learning curve will stay this sharp for a long time.

I couldn't finish this post without thanking an amazing team who I had the pleasure to work with. Special Thanks to Joao and Carlos, whoâ€™ve stopped to help me many times during this 7-week project, and everyone else for their company (we have a bye-bye dinner tomorrowðŸ˜› ). Hope to see you all soonðŸ™‚
